# scheduler-test
Little app to tell you when you should do stuff based on time

## Installation
1. clone repo
2. `npm i`

## Running from CLI
App runs from root using this format
```
node index.js HH:MM  <relative config path>
```
different mock files can be found in the `test` folder

## Tests
using mocha and chai
```
npm run test
```

## Linter
eslint using standard
```
npm run lint
```


### Dev note
eslint used with standard setup, not my usual style but creating config would of taken too long for this app.
